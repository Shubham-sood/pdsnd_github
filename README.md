Project Title:-
	Python project for the US Bikeshare Data

Description:-
	Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world.
	Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price.
	This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride.
	Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

	Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles.
	These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

	In this project, I will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. 
	You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
